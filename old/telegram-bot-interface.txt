 fill  Record entry of a new position-affecting fill
  — syntax: /new fill [date] [time] [ig | yg] raw bet description Location [EquityPartnership]

   
  — e.g.
    #1: /new fill 9/22 3:40pm oak/yankees u9-110 $1.5k dan thirds 
    #2: /new fill baylor -11.5 2.0 DKNG|batman alice5050
    #3: /new fill ig joe burrow total pass completions u23.5+05 $3250 eric

  Notes:
   - “yg” stands for “you got”, and indicates the WhoTurnedInType is Us
      “ig” stands for “i got”, and indicates the WhoTurnedInType type is Them
       it is an error to specify the WhoTurnedInType when the Location is an Account

   - every Fill has the following mandatory structural elements:  
     1) ticket details (each of these MUST be present in, or inferrable from "raw bet description")
     a) the distinct thing which gets graded 
      — e.g. cases:
       #1: oak/yankees u9
       #2: baylor -11.5 (can fail on account of being ambiguous if baylor is a school that plays both CBB and CFB and both teams have an upcoming match
        can fix by including enough information to disambiguate, for example:
         cbb baylor
          football baylor 
          139 baylor
         637 baylor
         (not an exhaustive list)
       #3: joe burrow total pass completions u23.5
     b) the size 
      — e.g. cases:
       #1: $1.5k
       #2: 2.0
       #3: $3250

     c) the price
      — e.g. cases:
       #1: -110
       #2: not specified: defaults to -110
       #3: +105

       2) the Location of the bet — either a Counterparty or an Account
     — e.g. cases:
      #1: in the first example, “dan” is parsed as a counterparty (assuming dan has been previously registered as a Counterparty using ‘/new counterparty’)
      #2: in the second example, “DKNG|batman” is parsed as the account (‘batman’ would also be sufficient, assuming we only have one account with that username)
      #3: in the third example, BJMP|AZ123 is parsed as the account location,
 
     [when Location is a Counterparty, WhoTurnedInType is ALSO REQUIRED]
      — e.g. cases:
       #1: will fail to identify a WhoTurnedInType from the message; if a default has been /set, use the default, otherwise fail
       #2: N/A because the Location (“DKNG|batman”) is an Account, not a Counterparty
       #3: in the third example, “ig” stands for “i got”, and indicates the turnin type is Them; in this case, counterparty “Eric” turned in to us

3) the [internal] profit-sharing agreement (aka, EquityPartnership)
     — e.g. cases:
      #1: Thirds is parsed as the EquityPartnership (assuming it has been previously registered with /new partnership)
      #2: Alice5050 is identified as the EquityPartnership (assuming it has been previously registered with /new partnership)
      #3: in the third example an EquityPartnership cannot be identified...
       ... if a default has been set using “/set turnin_partnership”
        the default will be used
       ... else
         this example WILL FAIL

4) the date and time of the turnin
      if date is specified:
          if year is not specified:
               year = coalesce(Defauls.current_year, Now().year)
      else (date not specified):
               date = coalesce(Defaults.current_date, Now().date)
      if time not specified:
              if date is today:
                   use current time
              else if date < today:
                    use 5:55am ET
